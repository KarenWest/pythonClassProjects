'''
McDonaldâ€™s sells Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 or 20 McNuggets. Thus,
it is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets (with one package of
6 and a second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly 16
McNuggets, since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's
add up to 16. To determine if it is possible to buy exactly n McNuggets, one
has to find non-negative integer values of a, b, and c such that

6a+9b+20c=n

Write a function, called McNuggets that takes one argument, n, and returns
True if it is possible to buy a combination of 6, 9 and 20 pack units such
that the total number of McNuggets equals n, and otherwise returns False.
Hint: use a guess and check approach.
